## Development Guidelines

1. **Code Modification**:
   - When modifying existing files, use `// ...existing code...` comments to represent unchanged regions.
   - Provide concise and clear changes to the code.

2. **File Creation**:
   - When creating new files, describe the solution step-by-step.
   - Group changes by file and use the file path as the header.
   - Use a single code block per file, even if there are multiple changes.

3. **Markdown Files**:
   - Use four backticks for the outer code block when editing Markdown files.

## Example Code Formatting

When providing code changes, follow this format:

```typescript
// filepath: /path/to/file
// ...existing code...
{ changed code }
// ...existing code...
{ changed code }
// ...existing code...
```
